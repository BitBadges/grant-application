# W3F Grant Proposal

We are working on creating a storage network module on substrate compatible w/ the BitBadges blockchain. This will allow for substrate to interact in a meaningful way with the BitBadges ecosystem, which follows an experimental PoCP or Proof of Computation proof. 

Other projects like [Crust](https://crust.network/) or [Subspace](https://www.subspace.network/) are within the same realm of trying to create some form of storage network. The difference is how BitBadges goes about accomplishing this and what a substrate module as an integration will provide. BitBadges as a whole is working on offline-centric networks and integrating variations of distributing sharding algorithms. Their data is transmitted w/ CouchDB being an integral part of its core for node syncronization. BitBadges is also integrating w/ various third party networks viewed as either pegs or applications. 

We believe that the substrate ecosystem can provide another integration w/ our network and we might even be able to create something similar to what Crust is doing on their mainnet, but w/ BitBadges as the storage method or a mirrored peg for the data. Our team, which is currently just two people, are passionate and have years of blockchain development experience under our belts. We think Substrate can work great as one of our third party integrations or pegged chains.
